# simd-playground

I'm really excited to get `std::simd` in the standard one day. This is a collection of implementations of SIMD-vectorized algorithms/ data structures using only the C++ standard library (no intrinsics) in an attempt to learn how to write more performant code (and that will actually make it through code review ;) ).
